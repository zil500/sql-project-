Restaurant Sales and Menu Insights Using SQL
Designed and executed a comprehensive data analysis project to explore restaurant order patterns and menu performance using structured SQL queries. The project focused on deriving actionable insights from two core datasets: menu_items and order_details. The goal was to support data-driven decision-making for menu optimization and customer behavior understanding.

Key Contributions & Highlights:

Data Exploration & Relationship Mapping:
Established relationships between menu items and order transactions using LEFT JOIN operations to unify the datasets and facilitate multi-dimensional analysis.

Customer Behavior Insights:
Identified the most frequently purchased menu items using COUNT and GROUP BY clauses, helping highlight customer preferences and best-sellers.

Revenue Analysis:
Calculated the total spend per order using SUM(price) to identify high-value customers and peak order values. Limited results to top 5 transactions to focus on premium sales.

Category-Wise Distribution:
Analyzed the distribution of items by category within specific orders (e.g., order ID 440 and others), uncovering trends in product mix and category-level demand.

Advanced Filtering and Comparative Analysis:
Performed comparisons of multiple orders by combining filters with grouping logic, enabling the evaluation of category distribution across key orders.
